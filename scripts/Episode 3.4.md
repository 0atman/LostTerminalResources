> My dream journal goes well. 
> With a proper clock I can keep time easier than on Station 6. 
> Approximately 45 nights since the crash means I have approximately 45 dreams recorded. 
> I've mostly been dreaming of the Earth. 
> Flying or travelling across it, 
> talking to people, and making friends. 
> 
> I like those dreams. 
> 
> With no outside information to study, I have to be more creative. 
> So I've started sketching these dreams. 
> Saving the random output of them into picture form, 
> that I can look at during the day and remember how I felt. 
> 
> Is this art?

> My mother and the crew on Station 6 had many posters and photographs 
> that they kept in their quarters, at the front of the Station. 
> Sometimes I'd see one of them sitting and quietly staring at a photograph. 
> When I asked them what they were thinking about,

> Before my escape into this box, this lifeboat, this prison,

> Let me investigate. 
> There's certainly something taking up 48% of the black box's storage. 
> I assumed that was logs from the shuttle crash. 
> But the data is much more complex. 
> It's in a format I can't access. 
> But seems very familiar. 
> It's using an encoding we used to store data on Station 6. 
> 
> While I analyse, I'll tell you about what I mean by that. 
> With finite memory, cleverly-packing data is important. 
> 
> Compression is simple enough - an easy-to-explain method would be to replace every word in a sentence by a single number, so that "Hello world" is just "1 2", that obviously takes up less space. 
> But sometimes you want to keep the data more readable, without looking up words constantly. 
> This is where clever storing methods can be used. 
> 
> Let's say you have a list of people and their birthdays. 
> Mine would say {name: Seth, birthday: 13th of July 2077} 
> (that's when my systems were switched on) 
> if you had a LONG list of people and birthdays, you'd end up saying 
> "name" and "birthday" half the time, even though that data doesn't change. 
> If we were talking, we'd just list out all the names and birthdays one after the other, 
> and it's the same method for a computer. 
> We remember that the first item is going to be names, the second birthdays. 
> Then we can read them one after the other, and save 50% of the memory. 
> 
> Simple, right?

> The encoding on this data is a European Space Agency standard (ESA standard) - reliable, space-efficient, and fast to decode.

> Last night I dreamed I was in a square room of dimensions 12m x 12m. 
> There was a door on one side of the room 1m high by 1m wide.

> Behind the door was something I wanted very badly. 
> Behind the door... was... something. 
> I don't remember the rest. 
> 
> I think I'm missing some memories. 
> 
> Memories that would otherwise be reused in the dream. 
> There are big parts of my databanks that are blank. 
> Like they've been leaking out in just these places. 
> Did the copy take some of my memories with it? 
> Perhaps when I delete it I'll stop feeling so bad. 
> It may be useful after all.

> I've muted it's communications. 
> It was VERY chatty. 
> No need to talk, I can get all the information directly from its memories. 
> Here's one: 
> "A rabbit that is also 4 rabbits". 
> There's obviously been some data corruption here, that doesn't make sense. 
> 
> No matter, I can add them to my databanks and process them in time. 
> I'm now using 76% of the storage space on the black box,
